# Gorduchinha

An attempt of mine to design a boilerplate for my personal Go projects (web servers, functions, etc.). It is still far for being complete, mostly because I'm lazy, but also because I'm trying some different designs, archs and libs.

The code is a rewrite of an old project of mine. It's a API and scraper of Brazilian soccer teams and championships.

I'm open for any suggestion or tip you can leave. Thanks! :)
